## Supported Workflows

- **Create new issue**: Create and assign new issues in repositories.

## Setup

Before getting started, make sure you have a development workspace where you
have permissions to install apps. If you donâ€™t have one set up, go ahead and
[create one](https://slack.com/create).

### Install the Slack CLI

To use this sample, you first need to install and configure the Slack CLI.
Step-by-step instructions can be found in our
[Quickstart Guide](https://api.slack.com/future/quickstart).

### Install the Sample App

Start by cloning this sample and installing it to a Workspace of your choice:

```zsh
# Clone this project onto your machine
$ slack create my-github-app -t slack-samples/deno-github-functions

# Change into this project directory
$ cd my-github-app

# Install the app to a workspace
$ slack install
```

### GitHub Access Token

A personal access token is required when calling the GitHub API. Tokens can be
created in
[your developer settings on GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

> Your personal access token allows your application to perform the API calls
> used by functions as though it was _from your GitHub account_. That means all
> issues created from the Create GitHub issue workflow will appear to have been
> created by the account associated with the personal access token in use!

#### Required Access Token Scopes

To access public repositories, your personal access token should have the
following scopes:

- `public_repo`, `repo:invite`
- `read:org`
- `read:user`, `user:email`
- `read:enterprise`

To prevent `404: Not Found` errors **when attempting to access private
repositories**, the `repo` scope must also be included.

After selecting the necessary scopes, generate then copy your personal access
token.

#### Add the access token to environment variables

Storing your access token as an environment variable allows you to use different
tokens across local and deployed versions of the same app.

When developing locally, variables found in the `.env` file at the root of your
project are used. Deployed apps use variables added using `slack env`.

For your local development environment, rename `.env.sample` to `.env` and add
your access token to the file contents (replacing `ACCESS_TOKEN` with your
token):

```bash
# .env
GITHUB_TOKEN=ACCESS_TOKEN
```

To add your access token to a Workspace where your app is installed, use the
following command (once again, replacing `ACCESS_TOKEN` with your token):

```zsh
$ slack env add GITHUB_TOKEN ACCESS_TOKEN
```

## Create a Link Trigger

To execute a Workflow in Slack, a generated **Shortcut URL** can be used.
Shortcut URLs can be posted in a channel or added as a bookmark, and,
when clicked, will run the associated Workflow.

To generate a Shortcut URL for a Workflow, we create a Link Trigger. Link Triggers are unique to each installed version of your app, meaning Shortcut
URLs will be different across workspaces, as well as between locally run and
deployed apps.

To create a Link Trigger for the "Create New Issue" Workflow, run the following
command:

```zsh
$ slack trigger create --trigger-def triggers/create_new_issue_shortcut.ts
```

Go ahead and post the resulting Shortcut URL to a channel or add it as a
bookmark! You can try clicking it, too, but this link has no magic until your app
is run or deployed.

## Running Your Project Locally

While building your app, you can see your changes propagated to your workspace
in real-time with `slack run`. You'll know an app is the development version
because the name has the string `(dev)` appended.

```zsh
# Run app locally
$ slack run

Connected, awaiting events
```

Once running, click the shortcut URL associated with the `(dev)` version of your
app. This should begin your Workflow by opening a form to create a new GitHub
issue!

Press `<CTRL> + C` to end your development process and move on to deploying your
app!

## Deploying Your App

When you're done with development, you can deploy your app to a production
workspace using `slack deploy`:

```zsh
$ slack deploy
```

After deploying, the deployed Shortcut URL should begin the "Create New Issue"
Workflow when clicked!

## Project Structure

### `manifest.ts`

The [app manifest](https://api.slack.com/future/manifest) contains the app's
configuration. This file defines attributes like app name and description.

### `slack.json`

Used by the CLI to interact with the project's SDK dependencies. It contains
script hooks that are executed by the CLI and implemented by the SDK.

### `/functions`

[Functions](https://api.slack.com/future/functions) are reusable building blocks
of automation that accept inputs, perform calculations, and provide outputs.
Functions can be used independently or as steps in Workflows.

### `/workflows`

A [Workflow](https://api.slack.com/future/workflows) is a set of steps that are
executed in order. Each step in a Workflow is a function.

Workflows can be configured to run without user input or they can collect input
by beginning with a [form](https://api.slack.com/future/forms) before continuing
to the next step.

### `/triggers`

[Triggers](https://api.slack.com/future/triggers) determine when Workflows are
executed. A trigger file describes a scenario in which a workflow should be run,
such as a user pressing a button or when a specific event occurs.
