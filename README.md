## Supported Workflows

- **Create new issue**: Create and assign new issues in repositories.

## Setup

Before getting started, make sure you have a development workspace where you
have permissions to install apps. If you donâ€™t have one set up, go ahead and
[create one](https://slack.com/create).

### Install the Slack CLI

To use this sample, you first need to install and configure the Slack CLI.
Step-by-step instructions can be found in our
[Quickstart Guide](https://api.slack.com/future/quickstart).

### Install the Sample App

Start by cloning this sample and installing it into a workspace:

```zsh
# Clone this project onto your machine
$ slack create my-github-app -t slack-samples/deno-github-functions

# Change into this project directory
$ cd my-github-app

# Install the app to a workspace
$ slack install
```

### GitHub Access Token

A personal access token is required when calling the GitHub API. Tokens can be
created in
[your developer settings on GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

> Your personal access token allows your application to perform the API calls
> used by functions as though it was _from your GitHub account_. That means all
> issues created from the Create GitHub issue workflow will appear to have been
> created by the account associated with the personal access token in use!

#### Required Access Token Scopes

To access public repositories, your personal access token should have the
following scopes:

- `public_repo`, `repo:invite`
- `read:org`
- `read:user`, `user:email`
- `read:enterprise`

To prevent `404: Not Found` errors when attempting to access private
repositories, the `repo` scope must also be included.

After selecting the necessary scopes, generate then copy your personal access
token.

#### Add the access token to environment variables

<!-- TODO: This is the first mention of local vs. deployed versions of apps;
     do we need to introduce this concept earlier? can we use the term "dev app"
     rather than "locally-running"? since the app name has "(dev)" in it I
     think that's clearer? -->
Storing your access token as an environment variable allows you to use different
tokens across local and deployed versions of the same app.

##### Locally-running application environment variables

When developing locally, variables found in the `.env` file at the root of your
project are used. For your local development environment, rename `.env.sample`
to `.env` and add your access token to the file contents (replacing `ACCESS_TOKEN`
with your token):

```bash
# .env
GITHUB_TOKEN=ACCESS_TOKEN
```

##### Deployed application environment variables

Deployed apps use variables added using `slack env`. To add your access token to
a Workspace where your deployed app is installed, use the following command
(once again, replacing `ACCESS_TOKEN` with your token):

```zsh
$ slack env add GITHUB_TOKEN ACCESS_TOKEN
```

## Create a Link Trigger

[Triggers][triggers] execute a Workflow; they are an entry point into your
application that are invoked automatically by Slack or manually by users.
This application uses a [Link Trigger][link-triggers] to execute its Workflow
in Slack. Link triggers generate a **Shortcut URL** that unfurls into a button
within Slack. Shortcut URLs can be posted in a channel or added as a bookmark,
and, when clicked, will run the associated Workflow.

To generate a Shortcut URL for a Workflow, we first create a Link Trigger. Link
Triggers are unique to each installed version of your app, meaning Shortcut URLs
will be different across workspaces, as well as between locally run and deployed
apps.

To create a Link Trigger for the "Create New Issue" Workflow, run the following
command:

```zsh
$ slack trigger create --trigger-def triggers/create_new_issue_shortcut.ts
```

You will need to select the Workspace that you want to create your Link Trigger
in _as well as_ which instance of your application to execute when invoked. You
can differentiate between the locally-running version of your application from
the deployed version by the application name in the list: the name with the suffix
`(dev)` is your locally-running version while the name without it is the deployed
version.

Once you selected the Workspace and the application instance, the `slack trigger create`
command will output a Shortcut URL. Copy and paste this URL to a channel or add
it as a bookmark.

<!-- TODO: not entirely true... since the workflow starts with a builtin function (open form)
     it will seem to work just fine. the issue is that any custom app functions wont
     execute since those are not deployed or running locally... -->
You can try clicking it, too, but this link won't run the Workflow until the app
is either running locally or deployed!

## Running Your Project Locally

While building your app, you can see your changes propagated to your workspace
in real-time with `slack run`. You'll know an app is the development version
because the name has the string `(dev)` appended.

```zsh
# Run app locally
$ slack run

Connected, awaiting events
```

Once running, click the [previously created Shortcut URL][create-trigger] associated
with the `(dev)` version of your app. This should begin your Workflow by opening
a form to create a new GitHub issue!

To stop running locally, press `<CTRL> + C` to end the process.

## Deploying Your App

When you're done with development, you can deploy a production version of your app
to Slack's infrastructure using `slack deploy`:

```zsh
$ slack deploy
```

After deploying, the [previously created Shortcut URL][create-trigger] associated
with the production (non-`(dev)`) version of your app should begin the "Create New
Issue" Workflow when clicked!

### Viewing Activity Logs for Your Production App

Unlike when [running your project locally][run-locally], activity logs from the
production instance of your application are not streamed to your laptop. However,
you can still view its logs with the `slack activity` command:

```zsh
$ slack activity
```

## Project Structure

### `manifest.ts`

The [app manifest](https://api.slack.com/future/manifest) contains the app's
configuration. This file defines attributes like app name and description.

### `slack.json`

Used by the CLI to interact with the project's SDK dependencies. It contains
script hooks that are executed by the CLI and implemented by the SDK.

### `/functions`

[Functions](https://api.slack.com/future/functions) are reusable building blocks
of automation that accept inputs, perform calculations, and provide outputs.
Functions can be used independently or as steps in Workflows.

### `/workflows`

A [Workflow](https://api.slack.com/future/workflows) is a set of steps that are
executed in order. Each step in a Workflow is a function.

Workflows can be configured to run without user input or they can collect input
by beginning with a [form](https://api.slack.com/future/forms) before continuing
to the next step.

### `/triggers`

[Triggers][triggers] determine when Workflows are executed. A trigger file
describes a scenario in which a workflow should be run, such as a user pressing
a button or when a specific event occurs.
